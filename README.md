# Mediapipe
Using env file(.yaml) can be used to create the environment to run and test the code, also all liberies and version will be installed. please use the standard yaml conda installation command to install the enviornment in your system. There are 2 soluttion given both the solutions 80% similar the only differnece comes in the calculation of the output. So both the solution are starting with the liberies installation. Using the liberies such as opencv, mediapipe, numpy. intially using the liberies the access to the camera are obtained to capture the landmark. The model used for the in-built Pose function to detect the landmark. dection and tracking ar kept at 0.5 to reduce the error as in the webcam of the system are used. The obtianed image is convert into RBG to BGR for the openCV format. Using the pose function the model landamrk are obtained, landmark for each part are named to numbers for easy identification. each landmark and part maping picture is given to understand it.

Using this coordinates are obtained then using the geometery the jump is calcated where 2 type of solution are used. Check on the code to understand, rest it just basic geometery.
